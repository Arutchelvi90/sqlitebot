#summary tips on compiling sqlite for Visual C++

This is a summary of steps that I went through to compile the sqlite3.lib static library and some sample C++ code which utilizes that library to connect, write and query from a sample sqlite database.

This was done using the free Visual C++ 2008 Express edition IDE from Microsoft.

First download the latest C source code zip [http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3_6_22.zip sqlite-amalgamation-3_6_22.zip] from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

Start a new project where the application type will be a static library and uncheck the precompiled headers option.

Add the .c source file to the 'Source Files' of the project and the .h files to the 'Header Files' of the project and compile a 'Release' version of the sqlite.lib file
