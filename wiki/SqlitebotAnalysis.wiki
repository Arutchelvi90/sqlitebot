Sample gnuplot generated analysis maps

The left map is the starting map showing walls and the legend where
  * green plus=player start
  * blue cross=health
  * purple square=weapon
  * red cross=ammo

The right map shows the locations where the player was 'last seen' during gameplay, the influence of the health pickups can be seen

The end goal would be to use these time-accumulated statistics to influence the bot pathing goals or detect and address possible event or frequency related strategies associated with these observed patterns.
