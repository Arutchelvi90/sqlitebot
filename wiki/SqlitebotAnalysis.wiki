#summary planner or analysis scripts

Currently the MapGenerator script provides the map content(walls,pickups,etc) via text files to the [http://www.gnuplot.info gnuplot] graphing tool([http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.5 demo gallery],[http://www.tatsuromatsuoka.com/gnuplot/Eng/winbin/ windows download]) which is combined with observed data from the [SqlitebotSchema database schema] output as text files and also given as input to gnuplot.

Sample gnuplot generated analysis maps

The left map is the starting map showing walls and the legend where
  * green plus=player start
  * blue cross=health
  * purple square=weapon
  * red cross=ammo

The right map shows the locations where the player was 'last seen' during gameplay, the influence of the health pickups can be seen

The end goal would be to use these time-accumulated statistics to influence the bot pathing goals(for example, weighting highly trafficed pathnodes more heavily for selection) or detect and address possible event or frequency related strategies associated with these observed patterns.
