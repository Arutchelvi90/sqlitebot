= Introduction =

This is an open source project which is trying to utilize a sqlite database to store gaming bot location and situational awareness to help better adapt gaming AI(Artificial Intelligence) and behaviors for games.

The project is starting utilizing the [http://artemis.ms.mff.cuni.cz/pogamut/tiki-index.php Pogamut] Java/NetBeans based project code.

My(jeremy.cothran@gmail.com) development background is more with Perl so I'll be learning some Java and NetBeans as I go.  I've played with Unrealscript (similar to Java) in the past and familiar with some of the Unreal Tournament 2004 bot functions but will be learning more about that also as I go.

The initial goals of the project are:

  # Java - figure out how to properly break my files up so functions and variables are scoped properly
  # begin modifying bot behavior in interesting ways based on sqlite database lookups(locational/situational memory)

The initial sqlite table would be structured something like:

{{{
CREATE TABLE obs_type (
    row_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    row_entry_date text,
    location text,
    status text
);
}}}

with *location* reflecting the bots map location when a specified *status* (made a kill, was killed,etc) at a specified time(row_entry_date).

Tracking those things initially should allow a bot to begin selecting better and worse map locations for optimal scoring or begin time-based tactics or behaviors relating to location and predicted location of opponents.

For notes on using subversion for this project, see the notes at http://code.google.com/p/rcoos/wiki/SubversionNotes which should apply the same for this project except that the project name is 'sqlitebot' instead of 'rcoos'
