= Introduction =

This is an open source project which is trying to utilize a sqlite database to store gaming bot location and situational awareness to help better adapt gaming AI(Artificial Intelligence) and behaviors for games.

The project is starting utilizing the [http://artemis.ms.mff.cuni.cz/pogamut/tiki-index.php Pogamut] Java/NetBeans based project code.

My(jeremy.cothran@gmail.com) development background is more with Perl so I'll be learning some Java and NetBeans as I go.  I've played with Unrealscript (similar to Java) in the past and familiar with some of the Unreal Tournament 2004 bot functions but will be learning more about that also as I go.

The initial goals of the project are:

  # Java - figure out how to properly break my files up so functions and variables are scoped properly
  # begin modifying bot behavior in interesting ways based on sqlite database lookups(locational/situational memory)
