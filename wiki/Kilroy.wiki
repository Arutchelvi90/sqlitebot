== Development ideas = 


breakout team into squads with command board - offense, defense, scramble

pair or more offense to break through lines - first might die, but second avenges and breaks through

ambush on choke points for defense, offense

use cover for movement, facing, heatmap

use offense to scout - can see direction and use calculated enemy los or predicted movement+los to pathfind where not to be found or distract enemy in needed direction for traps or to get flag

use knowledge of deaths/respawn, team count to change tactics where man advantage

>>simple move-behind - track enemy distance/angle vs self to move out of viewing angle or behind - in paired coordinated movement with enemy reaction, kill enemy(s) not facing between pair

==individual bots

role - attack, defend, scramble

timeLastCommand - time last command for cooldowns

targetTrack - name of enemy bot tracking

----
4 defenders - default 4 direction facing for open flag?

assign nearest defending individual to tracking closest enemy threat - one defense per enemy unit, move defend facing angle if current facing greater than some x(radians? degrees?)

if lose attacker by wall or distance while tracking - start longer cooldown wait to defense reset

----

use los calculations to specify where to position(cover) and *not* to look/scan on defense

on dropped flag(killed flag runner) - re-evaluate goal command
  double-check to see flanking goal is flag location and not flagbase for dropped flag

when runners killed mark high-level grid area and avoid area if consistently killed

runners try random setup locations around enemy flag(direction/radius) to probe weaknesses, repeat/avoid based on success/failure

scrambling bots could ‘charge’ down attacking bots/runners from cover/behind
