#summary StarCraft AI competition

This is a placeholder wiki page for details regarding bot/strategy development for the [[StarCraft]] AI competition detailed at http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarCraftAICompetition

I got the BWAPI tools and terrain analysis (BWTA) installed without too much issue.  My basic plan at this point is to use a sqlite database as a data 'foundation' to monitor,control and analyze the production and micro-management of units and groups towards game-winning strategies.  More details as I experiment and open to others who want to collaborate or share development,testing or documentation in some way.

An initial database schema could be the same as or modified from an existing squad control schema at SqlitebotSchema , will have to see how this meshes with existing [http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/ functions] for controlling StarCraft AI.
