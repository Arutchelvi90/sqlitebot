#summary instructions for Unity browser zombie/deathmatch game

<wiki:toc max_depth="6">

= Introduction =

Game may still be very buggy, haven't had a chance to test multiplayer much at all.  Feel free to post comments or feedback at page bottom.

Current game link is at
http://www.kongregate.com/games/garcia1968/bled2zed

Using an account with a limit of 100 concurrent players.  10 player max per room.

Just install the browser unity plug-in if not already installed, then the game should appear after a bit.  Click 'go' to create room or join an existing room.  Can name/create your own room.  Rooms stay up as long as at least 1 player present.

*The goal of the game for the current version is basically to try and get the highest score by staying alive longest the most often.*  You get no score for your initial 30 seconds of time alive, but each 30 seconds after that will accumulate points, with each successive 30 seconds alive acting as a score multiplier(so seconds 30-60 = 30 points, 60-90 = +60 points, ...)  The 'round' time is currently 720 seconds(12 minutes) at the end of which the scores are reset to zero.

You'll start out in the middle of the map, next to a large tiled tower where zombies are spawned out every 5 seconds to a max of 20 zombies.  The zombies have a radius of player detection - it's smaller when you're still and wider when you're walking/running.

To run, hold left or right shift, but you can only run in small bursts before being forced back to a walk.

Movement is 'WASD' or arrow keys.  Mouse to look.  Space to jump.

*Press 'F' to fire, although you have to be in first person to fire(press 'C' to toggle between first and third person view).*  There is a small red dot screen center which represents your aim(less accurate in third person view).  *Press 'R' to reload*.

Your status readout(updated every 5 seconds) is upper right corner:

  * *time* - seconds since last death
  * *score* - a multiplier of time, the longer you stay alive the higher the multiplier
  * *health* 
    * start at 100
    * below zero and you're dead
    * if you get hit by zombie or player bullet you'll start to bleed out indicated by '(-)' next to your health score, more hits increases the bleed rate
  * *bandages*
    * *press 'B' to bandage*, but you have to stay in the same spot for 6 seconds and not fire your gun - otherwise the bandage doesn't 'take'
    * max 3 bandages
  * *bullets(reload count)*
    * on new life always start with 24 bullets, max  bullets is 24
    * reload count is 6 - takes 2 seconds to reload - short delay between firing rounds

  * *Zombies*
    * takes about 5 shots to kill
    * zombies alert nearby zombies when they are chasing you
    * when a gun fires, zombies within a large radius will temporarily become more alert move toward the gunfire location
    * respawn towards a level maximum of 6 zombies total

There are 5 fixed player spawn points on the map indicated by a metal tile.  There's one on top of a building with a plank laid to the building side to go up and down - if you drop off a building you will die from the fall.  If you run off the edge of the map, you will die from the fall.

----
= *Pickups* - Ammo,Bandages,Health = 

There are 6 pickup spawns on the map indicated by a white tile.  The 3 pickup types are small color code cubes - yellow for 3 ammo, white for 1 bandage, red for 30 health.  A pickup(higher chance for ammo) spawns at a random location every 15 seconds.

Pickup locations are circled in red on the below map.
