In developing bot AI for Unreal Tournament 2004(UT2004), the need for the bots to better strategically/tactically understand is important.  Towards that goal, I've created an initial simple [perl script] which utilizes a [config.ini file] to generate a random room configuration of varying intersecting lights,walls and pickups.

The above image(DM-Out3Big.ut2) for instance of a large generated map(shown in UnrealEd, the Unreal editing tool) is 8,000x24,000 UU(Unreal Units) in size.
