In developing bot AI for Unreal Tournament 2004(UT2004), the need for the bots to better strategically/tactically understand is important.  Towards that goal, I've created an initial simple [perl script] which utilizes a [config.ini file] to generate a random room configuration of varying intersecting lights,walls and pickups.

The above image(DM-Out3Big.ut2) for instance of a large generated map(shown in UnrealEd, the Unreal editing tool) is 8,000x24,000 UU(Unreal Units) in size.

This is the big map (8,000x24,000 UU size) shown in the page top image.  It does not have any pathnodes included for bot play.

This is a smaller map (4,000x8,000 UU size) shown in the below image.  It does include a grid of bot pathnodes for bot play.
