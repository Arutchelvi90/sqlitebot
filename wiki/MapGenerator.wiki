= Intro =

In developing bot AI for Unreal Tournament 2004(UT2004), the need for the bots to better strategically/tactically understand is important.  Towards that goal, I've created an initial simple [http://code.google.com/p/sqlitebot/source/browse/trunk/mapgen/ut_mapgen.pl perl script] which utilizes a [http://code.google.com/p/sqlitebot/source/browse/trunk/mapgen/config.ini config.ini file] to generate a random room configuration of varying intersecting lights,walls and pickups(aka a '*Danger Room*' ala X-Men :).

The above map image(DM-Out3Big.ut2) for instance of a large generated map(shown in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealEd UnrealEd], the Unreal editing tool included with UT2004) is 8,000x24,000 UU(Unreal Units) in size.

The config file allows for a simple gridded pathnode pass on the map for bots to utilize for pathing/navigation.  Better pathnode generation for bot AI utilization will be the focus of ongoing efforts.

  *A Windows-based version of perl for running the script can be found at [http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/ ActivePerl]
  * The script generates a .t3d ASCII readable text file, which will need to be imported into UnrealEd and saved as a .ut2 map for play
  * The script is an initial version and uses a memory hash for preventing overlaps between the geometry,pickups,etc.  This results in memory being soaked up from your system for the hash, so if the script dies it is probably because it ran out of system memory.  I'll fix this in a later version to buffer objects using just a distance calculation between objects.
  * The map as displayed in UnrealEd top-down view is 180 degrees opposite(positive y goes down the screen)

This is the big map (8,000x24,000 UU size) shown in the page top image.  It does not have any pathnodes included for bot play.

This is a smaller map (4,000x8,000 UU size) shown in the below image.  It does include a grid of connected bot pathnodes for bot play/testing.

== !Out3Disconnect ==

Download [http://sqlitebot.googlecode.com/files/DM-Out3Disconnect.ut2 DM-Out3Disconnect.ut2]

This is a smaller map (4,000x8,000 UU size) shown in the below image.  It include more walls which break the gridded pathnodes into disjoint areas.  A more interesting map for human players with the additional walls, but difficult for bots to currently path/navigate.

The config.ini file currently supports the following map parameters.  Note only the listed pickup types are currently supported, can include more as requested or see the code

= Further Development =

  * better pathnode analysis and placement.  Analyze map for areas which should be connected with the minimal or most useful number of pathnodes
  * gameplay/AI movement/event logging via sqlite relational database(RDB) with results such as map hotspots,etc displayed as a secondary map or overlay image
    * map feature extraction/rating for further auto-generation of maps with similar features
  * additional map shapes,objects,textures - area grouping of textures,lighting
  * integration of map/pathnode generation with AI strategic/tactical attributes(visibility,cover,area,etc) generation - stored within RDB schema
