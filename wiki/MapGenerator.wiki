= Intro =

In developing bot AI for Unreal Tournament 2004(UT2004), the need for the bots to better strategically/tactically understand is important.  Towards that goal, I've created an initial simple [perl script] which utilizes a [config.ini file] to generate a random room configuration of varying intersecting lights,walls and pickups.

The above map image(DM-Out3Big.ut2) for instance of a large generated map(shown in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealEd UnrealEd], the Unreal editing tool included with UT2004) is 8,000x24,000 UU(Unreal Units) in size.

This is the big map (8,000x24,000 UU size) shown in the page top image.  It does not have any pathnodes included for bot play.

This is a smaller map (4,000x8,000 UU size) shown in the below image.  It does include a grid of connected bot pathnodes for bot play/testing.

This is a smaller map (4,000x8,000 UU size) shown in the below image.  It include more walls which break the gridded pathnodes into disjoint areas.  A more interesting map for human players with the additional walls, but difficult for bots to currently path/navigate.
